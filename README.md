a real-world example question that can be solved using Java basics:

## Question: Library Book Management

### Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a simple program to manage books in a small library. The library needs to keep track of its books, allowing the librarian to perform the following actions:

1. **Add a new book** to the collection.
2. **Display the details** of all books in the collection.
3. **Search for a book** by its title.

Each book has the following attributes:
- `Title`
- `Author`
- `ISBN` (International Standard Book Number)
- `Published Year`

### Requirements

1. **Add a Book**:
   - Prompt the user to enter the details of a new book.
   - Store the book in a list.

2. **Display Books**:
   - Display the details of all books in the collection.

3. **Search a Book**:
   - Prompt the user to enter the title of the book they want to search for.
   - Display the details of the book if found; otherwise, display a message saying the book is not found.

### Constraints
- Use only basic Java constructs: classes, methods, arrays (or ArrayList), loops, and basic input/output.

### Example
```
Enter 1 to add a book, 2 to display all books, 3 to search for a book, 4 to exit: 1
Enter Title: Java Programming
Enter Author: John Doe
Enter ISBN: 1234567890
Enter Published Year: 2020

Enter 1 to add a book, 2 to display all books, 3 to search for a book, 4 to exit: 2
Title: Java Programming, Author: John Doe, ISBN: 1234567890, Published Year: 2020

Enter 1 to add a book, 2 to display all books, 3 to search for a book, 4 to exit: 3
Enter Title to search: Java Programming
Title: Java Programming, Author: John Doe, ISBN: 1234567890, Published Year: 2020

Enter 1 to add a book, 2 to display all books, 3 to search for a book, 4 to exit: 4
Goodbye!
```
